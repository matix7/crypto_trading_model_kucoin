3. **Sentiment Analysis Module**: Analyzes market sentiment from various sources
4. **Machine Learning Prediction Engine**: Generates trading signals using ensemble models
5. **Risk Management System**: Controls risk exposure and position sizing
6. **Paper Trading Engine**: Executes trades in a simulated environment
7. **Backtesting Framework**: Tests strategies against historical data
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizes performance metrics and system status
