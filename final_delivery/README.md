# README: Crypto Trading Model

## Overview

This repository contains a self-learning, high-frequency crypto trading model that predicts short-term price movements using a symbiotic ensemble of technical indicators, real-time market sentiment, and price action patterns. The system autonomously optimizes its strategies based on trade outcome analysis, grows smarter with every success and failure, and maintains tight dynamic risk controls to secure capital while maximizing daily compounding gains of 3-5%.

## Key Features

- **Self-Learning Algorithm**: Continuously optimizes trading strategies based on performance
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Combines technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and price patterns
- **High-Frequency Trading**: Designed for short-term price movement prediction
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Adaptive position sizing and risk controls
