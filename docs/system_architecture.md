# KuCoin Crypto Trading Model Documentation

## System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for the KuCoin Crypto Trading Model, a self-learning high-frequency trading system designed to predict short-term price movements and execute trades autonomously.

### Core Components

The system consists of the following core components:

1. **Data Collection Module**
   - Connects to KuCoin API to fetch real-time and historical market data
   - Processes and stores data for technical analysis and machine learning
   - Implements rate limiting and error handling for reliable data collection

2. **Technical Analysis Module**
   - Calculates technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMAs, etc.)
   - Implements multiple trading strategies (trend following, mean reversion, breakout)
   - Combines signals from different strategies with adaptive weighting

3. **Sentiment Analysis Module**
   - Analyzes market sentiment from social media, news, and on-chain data
   - Processes text data to extract sentiment signals
   - Integrates sentiment indicators with technical analysis

4. **Machine Learning Prediction Engine**
   - Uses LSTM neural networks to detect non-linear patterns in price data
   - Implements ensemble learning to combine multiple prediction models
   - Self-optimizes based on performance feedback

5. **Risk Management System**
   - Implements dynamic position sizing based on signal strength and market conditions
   - Manages stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing stop orders
   - Enforces risk limits to protect capital

6. **Paper Trading Engine**
   - Simulates trades without real money for testing and validation
   - Tracks performance metrics and generates reports
   - Provides API endpoints for monitoring and control

7. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Visualizes trading performance and system metrics
   - Displays real-time market data and active positions
   - Provides configuration interface for system parameters

### Data Flow

1. The Data Collection Module continuously fetches market data from KuCoin
2. Technical indicators are calculated in real-time
3. Sentiment data is processed and combined with technical indicators
4. The Machine Learning Prediction Engine generates price movement predictions
5. Trading signals are generated by combining technical, sentiment, and ML signals
6. The Risk Management System determines position sizes and risk parameters
7. The Paper Trading Engine executes simulated trades
8. Performance metrics are calculated and displayed on the Analytics Dashboard

### System Integration

The components are integrated through a modular architecture with well-defined interfaces. This allows for:

- Independent development and testing of each component
- Easy replacement or upgrade of individual modules
- Flexible configuration for different trading strategies
- Scalability to handle multiple trading pairs and timeframes

### Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed as a web application with the following components:

1. **Backend API Server**
   - Provides REST API endpoints for the frontend
   - Manages the trading engine and data processing
   - Handles authentication and security

2. **Frontend Web Application**
   - Provides user interface for monitoring and configuration
   - Displays real-time data and performance metrics
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

3. **Database**
   - Stores historical data, trading records, and system configuration
   - Provides persistence for the trading engine

4. **Scheduled Tasks**
   - Handles periodic data collection and processing
   - Manages model retraining and optimization

The system is designed to be deployed on Vercel for easy hosting and scaling.
