# Cryptocurrency Trading Model Requirements Analysis

## User Requirements

Based on the user's request and the insights from the uploaded document, the following requirements have been identified for the high-frequency crypto trading model:

### Core Functionality
1. **Self-learning capability**: The model must autonomously optimize its strategies based on trade outcome analysis.
2. **High-frequency trading**: The system should be capable of executing trades at high frequency to capitalize on short-term price movements.
3. **Prediction accuracy**: Target success rate of approximately 85%.
4. **Daily returns**: Achieve daily compounding gains of at least 3-5%.
5. **Risk management**: Implement tight dynamic risk controls to secure capital.
6. **Autonomous operation**: The system should operate with minimal human intervention.
7. **Paper trading**: Initial implementation through paper trading in Vercel.
8. **Analytics**: Full analytics dashboard to monitor performance.
9. **Binance readiness**: Prepared for live deployment on Binance.

### Technical Components
1. **Technical indicators ensemble**: Utilize the most accurate technical indicators for price prediction.
2. **Market sentiment analysis**: Incorporate real-time market sentiment data.
3. **Price action patterns**: Identify and leverage price action patterns for prediction.
4. **Machine learning models**: Implement LSTM and other appropriate ML models.
5. **API integration**: Connect with Binance API for data retrieval and trade execution.
6. **Backtesting framework**: Test strategies against historical data.
7. **Performance optimization**: Continuous improvement of prediction accuracy.
